__NOTE:__ Many thanks to Alexander Vershilov for the implementation.

For the speed reasons you may want to dump logs asynchronously.
This is especially useful when application threads are CPU
bound while logs emitting is I/O bound. This approach
allows to mitigate bottlenecks from the I/O.

When writing an application user should be aware of the tradeoffs
that concurrent log system can provide, in this module we explain
potential tradeoffs and describe if certain building blocks are
affected or not.

  1. Unbounded memory usage - if there is no backpressure mechanism
  the user threads, they may generate more logs that can be
  written in the same amount of time. In those cases messages will
  be accumulated in memory. That will lead to extended GC times and
  application may be killed by the operating systems mechanisms.

  2. Persistence requirement - sometimes application may want to
  ensure that logs were written before it can continue. This is not
  a case with concurrent log systems in general, and some logs may
  be lost when application exits before dumping all logs.

  3. Non-precise logging - sometimes it may happen that there can be
  logs reordering (in case if thread was moved to another capability).

In case if your application is a subject of those problems you may
consider not using concurrent logging system in other cases concurrent
logger may be a good default for you.

{- $general

Concurrent logger consists of the basic parts (see schema below).

  1. Logger in application thread. This logger is evaluated in the
  application thread and has an access to all the context available
  in that thread and monad, this logger can work in any @m@.

  2. Communication channel with backpressure support. In addition to
  the channel we have a converter that puts the user message to the
  communication channel. This converter works in the user thread.
  Such a logger usually works in 'IO' but it's possible to make it
  work in 'Control.Concurrent.STM.STM' as well. At this point library provides only 'IO'
  version, but it can be lifted to any 'MonadIO' by the user.

  3. Logger thread. This is the thread that performs actual write to
  the sinks. Loggers there do not have access to the users thread
  state, unless that state was passed in the message.

@

So usually user should write the logging system in the way that all 'LogAction'
that populate and filter information should live in the application logger.
All loggers that do serialization and formatting should live in shared logger.


If more concurrency is needed it's possible to build multilayer systems:


@
  +-------------+                         +-------+
  | application |---+                 +---| sink-1|
  +-------------+   |   +---------+   |   +-------+
                    +---| logger  |---+
                        +---------+   |   +-------+
                                      +---| sink-2|
                                          +-------+
@

In this approach application will be concurrently write logs to the logger, then
logger will be concurrently writing to all sinks.

{- $simple-api

Simple API provides a handy easy to use API that can be used directly
in application without dealing with internals. Based on users feedback
internal implementation of the simple API may change, especially in early
versions of the library. But the guarantee that we give is that no matter
what implementation is it will be kept with reasonable defaults and will
be applicable to a generic application.

a thread that will run 'shared worker', see schema above.

in flight are allowed. In most cases 'defCapacity' will work well.
See 'forkBackgroundLogger' for more details.

application state or thread info, so you should only pass methods that serialize
and dump data there.

{- $background-worker
The main abstraction for the concurrent worker is 'BackgroundWorker'. This

notification of completeness unless it's included in the message itself.

chosen reasonably high and if this value is reached it means that

{- $worker-thread

While generic background logger is enough for the most
of the usecases, sometimes you may want even more.

There are at least two cases where that may happen:

  1. You need to modify logger, for example different
  threads wants to write to different sources. Or you
  want to change lgo mechanism in runtime.

  2. You may want to implement some notification
  machinery that allows you to guarantee that your
  logs were written before processing further.

In order to solve those problems worker thread abstraction
was introduced. This is a worker that accepts any action
and performs that.
-}

{- | Create a background worker with a given capacity.
If capacity is reached, then the thread that tries to
write logs will be blocked.

This method is more generic than 'forkBackgroundLogger' but
it's less effective, as you have to pass entire closure to
be run and that leads to extra memory usage and indirect calls
happening.

When closed it will dump all pending messages, unless
another asynchronous exception will arrive, or synchronous
exception will happen during the logging.
