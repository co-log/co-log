# Intro: Using `LogAction`

This tutorial is an introduction to `co-log`. It contains basic examples of
using core data types and functions.

You can run this tutorial by calling the following command:

```shell
cabal new-run intro
```

## Preamble: imports and language extensions

Since this is a literate haskell file, we need to specify all our language
extensions and imports up front.

```haskell
import Colog.Core (LogAction (..), (<&), logStringStdout)
```

## Core data type

`co-log` is based on the following data type:

```idris
newtype LogAction m msg = LogAction
    { unLogAction :: msg -> m ()
    }
```

Logging action is a function from some message of user-defined type `msg` that
performs all logic inside some monad `m`. In the `co-log` library **logger** is represented as a
value. With such approach, you can modify the way you do logging by simply performing some
transformations with the value you have.

Let's first look at a very basic example of simply using `putStrLn` for logging:

```haskell
example0 :: IO ()
example0 = do
    putStrLn "Example 0: First message"
    putStrLn "Example 0: Second message"
```

Using `putStrLn` for logging is a very simple and basic approach for logging.
When your application becomes bigger and more complex, you might want to bring
some logging library into it. For example, you might want to do something from
the following list:

1. Specify messages with the given `Severity` so you can control the verbosity
   of the output.
2. Automatically print timestamps, thread ids, source code line of the logging
   with each message.
3. You would like to submit some statistics to some web-server with each logging
   message so later you can have analytics provided by external parties.

Now let's look at how you can use `LogAction` instead of `putStrLn` to achieve the
same goal. With `co-log` you need to have a value of type `LogAction` that defines
how you are going to do logging. So you configure your logging settings separately and
then pass and use this `LogAction` value. See the following example for more
details:

```haskell
example1 :: LogAction IO String -> IO ()
example1 logger = do
    unLogAction logger "Example 1: First message"
    unLogAction logger "Example 1: Second message"
```

> **NOTE:** this function currently does exactly the same thing as in `example0`. However,
> given `LogAction` can do many different interesting things which you can
> configure later in one place and automatically get proper behavior for your
> whole application instead of changing the code of every function.

If you want to do logging with `co-log`, then one of the options (and the simplest one)
is to pass `LogAction` explicitly as an argument to your
function. In the example above, we are using `LogAction` that takes `String`s as messages
and performs logging inside `IO` monad.

For convenience, library defines useful operator `<&` that makes code more
concise and simpler:

```haskell
example2 :: LogAction IO String -> IO ()
example2 logger = do
    logger <& "Example 2: First message"
    logger <& "Example 2: Second message"
```

In order to do some logging, we need to pass some `logger` to our functions.
Here we are going to use the following `LogAction`:

```idris
logStringStdout :: LogAction IO String
```

This action uses `putStrLn` underhood and just prints given string to `stdout`.
In this particular case using `LogAction` from `co-log` might seem redundant,
however, now it's much easier to replace simple `putStrLn` with something more
complex and useful.

Putting all together, we can now perform our

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let logger = logStringStdout
    example0
    example1 logger
    example2 logger
```

And the output is exactly what you expect:

```
Example 0: First message
Example 0: Second message
Example 1: First message
Example 1: Second message
Example 2: First message
Example 2: Second message
```
