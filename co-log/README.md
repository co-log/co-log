Logging library based on [`co-log-core`](../co-log-core) package. Provides
ready-to-go implementation of logging. This README contains _How to_ tutorial on
using this library. This tutorial explains step by step how to integrate
`co-log` into small basic project, specifically how to replace `putStrLn` used
for logging with library provided logging.

All code below can be compiled and run with the following commands:

```shell
$ cabal new-build co-log
$ cabal new-exec readme
```

## Preamble: imports and language extensions

Since this is a literate haskell file, we need to specify all our language
extensions and imports up front.

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts  #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import Colog (Message, WithLog, cmap, fmtMessage, logDebug, logInfo, logTextStdout, logWarning,
              usingLoggerT)
import Control.Monad.IO.Class (MonadIO, liftIO)

import Data.Semigroup ((<>))
import qualified Data.Text as Text
import qualified Data.Text.IO as TextIO

```

## Simple IO function example

Consider the following function that reads lines from `stdin` and outputs
different feedback depending on the line size.

```haskell
processLinesBasic :: IO ()
processLinesBasic = do
    line <- TextIO.getLine
    case Text.length line of
        0 -> do
            -- here goes logging
            TextIO.putStrLn ">>>> Empty input"
            processLinesBasic
        n -> do
            TextIO.putStrLn ">>>> Correct input"
            TextIO.putStrLn $ "Line length: " <> Text.pack (show n)
```

This code mixes application logic with logging of the steps. It's convenient to
have logging to observe behavior of the application. But `putStrLn` is very
simple and primitive way to log things.

## Using `co-log` library

In order to use `co-log` library, we need to refactor `processLinesBasic`
function in the following way:

```haskell
processLinesLog :: (WithLog env Message m, MonadIO m) => m ()
processLinesLog = do
    line <- liftIO TextIO.getLine
    case Text.length line of
        0 -> do
            -- here goes logging
            logWarning "Empty input"
            processLinesLog
        n -> do
            logDebug "Correct line"
            logInfo $ "Line length: " <> Text.pack (show n)
```

Let's summarize required changes:

1. Make type more polymorphic: `(WithLog env Message m, MonadIO m) => m ()`
2. Add `liftIO` to all `IO` functions.
3. Replace `putStrLn` with proper `log*` function.

## Running actions

Let's run both functions:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
    processLinesBasic

    let action = cmap fmtMessage logTextStdout
    usingLoggerT action processLinesLog
```

And here is how output looks like:
