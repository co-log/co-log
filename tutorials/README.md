# Co-log Tutorial Series

This directory contains examples of using `co-log` library written as literate Haskell tutorials. Considering some prefer to read the source code directly, there are `.hs` files inside the corresponding folder.

| [LogAction: start to use co-log](./1-intro/Intro.md)                                    | In this tutorial, you will learn how to replace the `putStrLn` and `print` with `LogAction`                                                                                                           |
| [Simple message and LoggerT](./2-loggert/README.md)                                     | This tutorial will show you how to use `LoggerT` and Simple message to log with more information in a more flexiable way.                                                                             |
| [Message and LoggerT](./3-loggert-with-message/README.md)                               | This tutorial will show you how to use message and loggert to log with severity.                                                                                                                      |
| [Using custom monad that stores `LogAction` inside its environment](./custom/Custom.md) | This tutorial will show you how to custom monad to store `LogAction` inside its environment.                                                                                                          |
| [Collection of all common usages](./Main.hs)                                            | The code list all common usages about co-log, could check it to find out what you like.                                                                                                               |
| [Concurrent usages](./Concurrent.hs)                                                    | co-log also cares about concurrent logging. For this purpose we have the concurrent-playground executable where we experiment with different multithreading scenarios to test the library's behavior. |
