# Co-log Tutorial Series

This directory contains examples of using `co-log` library written as literate Haskell tutorials. Considering some prefer to read the source code directly, there are `.hs` files inside the corresponding folder.

| 2   | [Simple message and LoggerT](2-loggert/README.md)                                       | This tutorial will show you how to use `LoggerT` and Simple message to log with more information in a more flexiable way.                                                                             |
| 3   | [Using custom monad that stores `LogAction` inside its environment](3-custom/Custom.md) | This tutorial will show you how to custom monad to store `LogAction` inside its environment.                                                                                                          |

| 5   | [Concurrent usages](Concurrent.hs)                                                      | co-log also cares about concurrent logging. For this purpose we have the concurrent-playground executable where we experiment with different multithreading scenarios to test the library's behavior. |
